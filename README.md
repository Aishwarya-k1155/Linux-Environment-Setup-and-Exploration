# Linux-Environment-Setup-and-Exploration

## Environment
- OS: Ubuntu Linux
- Platform: VirtualBox
- User: Normal (non-root)

## Commands Practiced
pwd, ls, cd  
mkdir, touch, rm, rmdir  
cat, less, nano  
chmod  
top, df -h, free -m  

## Notes
- File permissions were modified using chmod.
- Ownership change using chown was not possible due to lack of sudo privileges, which demonstrates Linux security and privilege separation.

## Outcome
Practiced basic Linux navigation, file management, permissions, and system monitoring.
